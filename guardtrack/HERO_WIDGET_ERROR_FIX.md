# Hero Widget Error Fix

## üîç **Issue Identified**

The application was throwing a Hero widget error:

```
There are multiple heroes that share the same tag within a subtree.
Within each subtree for which heroes are to be animated (i.e. a PageRoute subtree), each Hero must
have a unique non-null tag.
In this case, multiple heroes had the following tag: <default FloatingActionButton tag>
```

### **Root Cause**
Multiple admin pages had `FloatingActionButton` widgets without unique `heroTag` properties. When these pages exist simultaneously in the widget tree (during navigation transitions), Flutter's Hero animation system encounters duplicate tags, causing the error.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Solution Implemented**

### **Added Unique Hero Tags**
Fixed all `FloatingActionButton` widgets by adding unique `heroTag` properties:

1. **AttendanceMapPage**: `heroTag: "attendance_map_fab"`
2. **EmployeeManagementPage**: `heroTag: "employee_management_fab"`
3. **NotificationsManagementPage**: `heroTag: "notifications_management_fab"`
4. **AssignmentManagementPage**: `heroTag: "assignment_management_fab"`
5. **SiteManagementPage**: `heroTag: "site_management_fab"`

### **Example Fix**
```dart
// Before (causing error)
floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
  onPressed: _refreshLocations,
  backgroundColor: AppColors.primaryBlue,
  child: const Icon(Icons.refresh, color: AppColors.white),
),

// After (fixed)
floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
  heroTag: "attendance_map_fab",  // ‚úÖ Unique tag added
  onPressed: _refreshLocations,
  backgroundColor: AppColors.primaryBlue,
  child: const Icon(Icons.refresh, color: AppColors.white),
),
```

## üîß **Technical Details**

### **Why This Happens**
- Flutter uses Hero widgets for smooth transitions between pages
- FloatingActionButton automatically wraps itself in a Hero widget
- Default heroTag is `<default FloatingActionButton tag>`
- Multiple FABs with same tag in widget tree = conflict

### **When This Occurs**
- During page transitions in admin portal
- When multiple admin pages are in navigation stack
- During route animations between admin screens

### **Hero Tag Naming Convention**
Used descriptive, unique tags following pattern: `"{page_name}_fab"`
- Clear identification of which page owns the FAB
- Prevents future conflicts if more FABs are added
- Easy to maintain and debug

## üéØ **Benefits**

1. **Eliminates Error**: No more Hero widget exceptions
2. **Smooth Navigation**: Proper Hero animations between admin pages
3. **Future-Proof**: Prevents similar issues with new admin pages
4. **Maintainable**: Clear naming convention for hero tags
5. **User Experience**: Seamless transitions in admin portal

## üöÄ **Result**

The Hero widget error has been completely resolved! Admin users can now:
- Navigate smoothly between all admin portal sections
- Use FloatingActionButton functionality without crashes
- Experience proper page transitions and animations
- Access all admin features without interruption

The fix ensures robust navigation throughout the admin portal while maintaining Flutter's Hero animation system integrity. üéâ
