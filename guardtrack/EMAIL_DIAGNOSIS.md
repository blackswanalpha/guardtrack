# 🔍 Email Service Diagnosis

## ❌ **Issue Identified: Email Not Configured**

The email service is not sending emails because the Gmail App Password is not configured.

### 🔧 **Current Status:**
- ✅ SMTP service code is implemented correctly
- ✅ PDF generation service is working
- ✅ App startup integration is in place
- ❌ **Gmail App Password is NOT configured** (still using placeholder)

### 📧 **Configuration Required:**

The file `lib/core/config/email_config.dart` currently has:
```dart
static const String senderPassword = 'your_gmail_app_password_here';
```

This needs to be replaced with your actual Gmail App Password.

## 🚀 **Step-by-Step Fix:**

### **Step 1: Generate Gmail App Password**

1. **Go to Google Account Settings:**
   - Visit: https://myaccount.google.com/
   - Click on "Security" in the left sidebar

2. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication (if not already enabled):**
   - Find "2-Step Verification"
   - Follow the setup process

3. **Generate App Password:**
   - Go to "Security" → "App passwords"
   - Select "Mail" as the app
   - Click "Generate"
   - **Copy the 16-character password** (e.g., `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`)

### **Step 2: Configure GuardTrack**

1. **Open the configuration file:**
   ```
   guardtrack/lib/core/config/email_config.dart
   ```

2. **Replace the placeholder password:**
   ```dart
   // Change this line:
   static const String senderPassword = 'your_gmail_app_password_here';
   
   // To this (with your actual App Password):
   static const String senderPassword = 'abcd efgh ijkl mnop';
   ```

3. **Save the file**

### **Step 3: Test the Configuration**

1. **Run the app** and check the logs for:
   ```
   Email service not configured: Email service is not properly configured.
   ```

2. **After configuration, you should see:**
   ```
   Sending daily attendance report on app startup...
   Email sent successfully
   Daily report sent successfully on app startup
   ```

## 🔍 **How to Verify It's Working:**

### **Check App Logs:**
When the app starts, look for these log messages:

**❌ Before Configuration:**
```
Email service not configured. Please set up Gmail App Password.
Failed to send daily report on startup: Email service not configured
```

**✅ After Configuration:**
```
Sending daily attendance report on app startup...
PDF report generated: /path/to/guardtrack_attendance_2024-01-15.pdf
Email sent successfully: ...
Daily report sent successfully on app startup
```

### **Check Your Email:**
- Look for email from: `kamandembugua18@gmail.com`
- Subject: `GuardTrack Daily Attendance Report - [Today's Date]`
- Should have a PDF attachment with attendance data

## 🛡️ **Security Notes:**

### **✅ Do This:**
- Use the 16-character App Password (not your regular Gmail password)
- Keep the App Password secure and private
- Enable 2-Factor Authentication on Gmail

### **❌ Don't Do This:**
- Don't use your regular Gmail password
- Don't share the App Password
- Don't commit the App Password to version control

### **🔒 For Production:**
Consider using environment variables:
```dart
static String get senderPassword => 
    Platform.environment['GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD'] ?? '';
```

## 🧪 **Testing After Configuration:**

Once configured, you can test by:

1. **Restarting the app** - Email should be sent automatically
2. **Checking the logs** for success messages
3. **Looking in your email inbox** for the report

## 📞 **Troubleshooting:**

If emails still don't work after configuration:

1. **Verify the App Password is exactly 16 characters**
2. **Check internet connection**
3. **Try regenerating the App Password**
4. **Ensure 2FA is enabled on Gmail**
5. **Check spam/junk folder**

## 🎯 **Summary:**

The email service is fully implemented and ready to work. The only missing piece is the Gmail App Password configuration. Once you set that up, emails will be sent automatically when the app loads.

**Next Action:** Configure the Gmail App Password in `email_config.dart`
